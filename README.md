Database Schema:

Patients table: Contains information about each patient, such as patient_id, name, age, gender, and contact_info.HealthRecords table: Stores health records for each patient with fields like record_id, patient_id (foreign key), date, weight, height, blood_pressure, and medical_condition.

Use Case:

Inserting Patient Information: You can use SQL queries to insert new patient records into the Patients table, including details like name, age, gender, and contact information.

Recording Health Data: Use SQL queries to add new health records to the HealthRecords table for specific patients. This includes data such as weight, height, blood pressure, and medical conditions, along with the corresponding date.

Retrieving Patient Health Overview: You can use SQL queries to retrieve a patient's health overview, which could include their latest health record (e.g., weight, height, blood pressure) along with any medical conditions they may have. You can also calculate metrics like BMI (Body Mass Index) from the height and weight data.

Analyzing Health Trends: By using SQL queries and functions, you can analyze health trends across patients. For example, you can calculate average weight, blood pressure distribution, or identify the most common medical conditions.

Update and Delete Operations: SQL allows you to update and delete records, which can be useful for managing changes in patient information or correcting any mistakes in the health records.

Remember to ensure proper data validation, security measures, and backups to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of the health data. SQL is a powerful tool for managing health-related information, but handling sensitive data requires extra care.
